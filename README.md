# Maze generator
A maze can be generated by starting with a predetermined arrangement of cells with wall sites between them.

## Requirements
First of all, you need Python **3.6** or **3.7** to run the script. After this, install the required packages. 
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Parameters
- **screen_width** - window width
- **screen_height** - window height
- **nx** - number of maze lines
- **ny** - number of maze columns

## Important
Ensure that you can do the following before you run the maze generation:
- **screen_width** can be divided by **nx** and get rest 0 
- **screen_height** can be divided by **ny** and get rest 0 

## Maze generation algorithms
* Depth-first search

## How to run it
Execute `python depthfirst.py` command to run the script.
